# Assignment 2 - Professional Portfolio
In this assignment I attempted to build my professional portlio from scratch using html and css.
The goal was to meet the acceptance criteria outlined below. 

#### User Story (Obtained from the assignment description)
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

#### Acceptance Criteria (Obtained from the assignment description)
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

#### Sample Final Outcome (Obtained from assignment instruction)

#### My Actions
* The project was created from scratch. I created two additional branches in the git repository (develop and html_css_base). I was thinking of creating additional branches for feature addition, but later realized that I am working along on this project and the project is created from scratch, so having those feature branches at this stage may not make sense. As such, I used the html_and_css branch to add all the commits and at the end merged to develop branch and then to main branch. I hope this will serve the purpose of using Git. 
* I added one of my publicly available projects in the work section, and kept the other project cards as placeholders.
* Similarly, I added actual link to my  Github page, and kept the other links (i.e. phone, email, resume etc.) as placeholder for this project.
* I've grabbed the images from the Gitlab content 
* I have added comments to HTML and CSS files and optimized the files
* I hope the url name is unique in repository sense, I could name it differently, but I thought this would be more reflective of the purpose of this link.
